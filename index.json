Scenario There are three types of participants in the scenario: organization, drivers and passengers.\n Organization : Organization is a company or a transportation authority that operates a dynamic taxi ridesharing service. Drivers : Taxi drivers can independently determine when to join and leave the service. Passengers : Passengers submit ride queries in real time via a mobile device  Each query indicates the origin and destination locations of the trip, as well as time windows constraining when the passenger wants to be picked up and dropped off.\nOnce receiving a new query, the organization will dispatch an \u0026ldquo;appropriate\u0026rdquo; taxi which is able to satisfy both the new query and the trips of existing passengers who are already assigned to the taxi.\n2. Problem This paper propose a two-fold goal.\n The first goal is to investigate the potential of taxi ridesharing in serving more taxi ride queries by comparing with the case where no ridesharing is conducted. The second goal is to reduce the total travel distance of these taxis (so as to reduce the energy consumption) when doing the ridesharing.  So the problem is to build a dynamic ridesharing service applicable for the practical use, i.e. serving a large number of queries quickly. To achieve this purpose, two issues need to be addressed.\n The first issue : How to quickly search an \u0026ldquo;appropriate\u0026rdquo; taxi from a large number of candidate cars? The second issue : How to accelerate the computation of shortest paths since the shortest path calculation is usually complicated?  3.
